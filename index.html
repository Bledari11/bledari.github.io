    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I’m Bledar Shala, a software developer based in Pristina, Kosovo. My work focuses on the .NET ecosystem, where I thrive on solving complex problems, optimizing systems, and driving innovation. Beyond coding, I’m passionate about sharing knowledge, fostering growth in others, and exploring how technology can make a meaningful impact.</p>

    <h2>My Journey</h2>

    <p>My journey into the world of technology began with curiosity and a love for problem-solving. Early on, I was captivated by games like Scratch and Chess, which challenged me to think creatively and strategically. This problem solving passion evolved more during my Computer Science studies, where I dove deeper into programming and discovered the vast potential of technology to transform ideas into reality.</p>
    <p>My first step was at Bonevet, where I spent nine months not only learning but also teaching kids the foundations of programming. It was here that I discovered a deep passion for inspiring new generations to embrace and love the programming world. Teaching allowed me to share my knowledge while refining my skills, and it deepened my dedication to continuous growth—both for myself and those around me.</p>
    <p>As a naturally curious individual, I sought greater challenges. This led me to enroll in the LIFE Scholarship Program by Gjirafa, where I gained career-ready engineering skills. After successfully completing the program, I joined Gjirafa where I worked with diverse technologies to tackle different problems, mastering the entire software development lifecycle—from designing and testing to full-stack coding. This hands-on experience transformed me into a well-rounded software developer, equipping me with the skills to innovate, adapt, and excel in dynamic environments.
